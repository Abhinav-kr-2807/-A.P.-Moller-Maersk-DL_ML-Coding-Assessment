# Dataset

## Overview

This repository contains two datasets:

- **df_train**: Training data with 550,176 rows and 8 columns, including ProductType, Manufacturer, Area Code, Sourcing Channel, Product Size, Product Type, Month of Sourcing, and Sourcing Cost.

- **df_test**: Test data with 96 rows and 8 columns, containing the same features as the training dataset.

## Purpose

The datasets aim to analyze and predict sourcing costs for different products in the supply chain. They provide insights into factors influencing sourcing costs and serve as the basis for building predictive models to optimize sourcing strategies and improve cost efficiency.

## Features

- **ProductType**: Type of product.
- **Manufacturer**: Manufacturer of the product.
- **Area Code**: Code representing the area.
- **Sourcing Channel**: Channel through which sourcing is done.
- **Product Size**: Size of the product.
- **Product Type**: Type of product (duplicate column).
- **Month of Sourcing**: Month when sourcing occurred.
- **Sourcing Cost**: Cost incurred in sourcing the product.

## Usage

The datasets can be used for:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of variables and identify patterns.
- Feature engineering to create new features or transform existing ones.
- Building predictive models to estimate sourcing costs based on various factors.
